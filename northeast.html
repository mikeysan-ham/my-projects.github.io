    </font>
<br><br>
Northeastern India is one of the richest floras in India,
where people depend on shifting cultivation systems
and forest based food products for their sustainable
survival. This region, which lies under eastern
Himalayan ecosystem, is not only rich in plants
diversity but also have a great treasure of cultural,
social and linguistic variability, conserved by tribal
people. The region is a treasure of indigenous
knowledge systems pertaining to agriculture, food,
medicine, and natural resources management. People
are habituated to live and survive with the forest and
Jhum cultivation culture, which ensure a range of
ethnic foods rich in nutrition and compatible to
culture and ethnicity of tribes1
. Since time
immemorial, rural women of this region have selected
many wild plants and non-vegetarian foods through
trial and error2
. Women have conserved many local
crops, ethnic vegetables and indigenous fruits used in
local diet for food and nutritional security. Most of
these indigenous materials are collected by women
folk either from the forest areas, conserved in shifting
land or indigenous kitchen gardens3-5. These
ethnobotanical resources used in traditional foods are
based on the location specific demand, culture,
economy, ethnicity, food habit and overall needs1,4-6.
Different fermented and non-fermented foods are
used in various combinations with traditional
vegetables to meet the food and nutritional security6
.
Mainly the different tribal women share these
traditional foods at community level in various
cultural occasions
