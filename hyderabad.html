The city of Hyderabad, famous for its minarets and pearl-bazaars, is the capital city of the state of Andhra
Pradesh, a bustling 400-year-old metropolis of some 6 million. Long renowned as the seat of the fabulously wealthy
Nizams(rulers) who patronized expert artisans, famous for piercing and stringing pearls, it is a historic urban center
that brings to mind romance and fabulous wealth. Like most of India's cities, it is a blend of fairytale and reality, a
hodge-podge of old and new, forming an exotic background for its much sought after delightful cuisine.
Asaf Jahi, one of the viceroys of the Mughal Empire in the 16th century, broke away to establish his own
independent state. Thereafter his descendents gave themselves the title Nizam. In 1798, a military and political
alliance was signed between the Nizam and the British, which continued until India became independent. During
these centuries, the city developed an unique cultural and culinary heritage, which remains well preserved.
Today, the people of Hyderabad are noted for their culture, artistic abilities and certain sophistication in
manners. The fifth largest cosmopolitan city in India, it is a city of oriental glory, reminiscent of the great days of
Indo-Muslim culture. It is well known for its hospitality and visitors to the city have always found a pleasant
welcome and fine foods on which to dine.
India's finest cuisine was developed, from the 15th to the 19th centuries, in the courts of the Mughal
Emperors, who raised cooking to an art form. Today, in all parts of India and beyond, it is offered as that country's
royal food. The rich kitchen of these refined aristocrats included a fusion of the indigenous culinary traditions,
which had been nurtured for almost 3,000 years by the Vedic and Aryan people, with the foods of Arabia, Persia,
Afghanistan and the Turkish nations - later enhanced by including European touches. Being an offshoot of the
Mughals, the Nizams of Hyderabad were a party to this development of a fine distillation of taste.
The Mughal court food and India's predominant Hindu culture formed the basis of the kitchen of the Nizams.
This cuisine, combining the Muslim Mughal cooking court with the historic foods of the country, produced a
kitchen that was to become the definition of fine dining.
