There is a big humor that where other people of the world “eat to live” Bengalis “live just to eat”.
Every Bengali festival/occasion always followed by a huge banquet. There is a big bonding of various cuisines
of fish and rice with Bengali’s culture which has a unique feature of being an assimilation of the best of the
world gastronomy and Indian diverse cookery. West Bengal is place enriched by multiple rivers, with the main
crop paddy. Many types of fishes are available here. All Bengali cuisine is full of protein (especially different
pulses and fishes) and huge roughage. In ancient era, every spices used in Bengali’s kitchen has its own
medicinal value. Before industrial revolution pesticides or genetically modified food was not there. Our
objective is to take care of health with taste and conservation of our Bengali’s cultural uniqueness. All Bengali
rituals and festivities end up with hearty feasts, involving an astonishing number of intricately prepared dishes.
In this work, we have tried to analyze the development of Bengali cuisine in the early modern age, i.e., the
18th and early 19th centuries, an era when colonial influence was still not predominant. We have focused
primarily on West Bengal, India and mainly discussed the history of cooked food and the impact of those foods
on heath from past to present days. The industrialization of the agricultural sector has increased the chemical
burden on neutral ecosystem which is taking the Bengali far away from their ancient food, culture and heath.
