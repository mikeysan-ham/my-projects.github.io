    </font>
<br><br>
Gujarati cuisine refers to the cuisine of the people from the state of Gujarat in the Northwest Region of India.
It is all vegetarian, due to Hinduism and Jainism. The typical Gujarati Thali consists of Rotli (a flat bread made from
wheat flour), daal or kadhi, rice, and sabzi/shaak (a dish made up of different combinations of vegetables and spices,
which may be stir fried, spicy or sweet). Cuisine varies in taste and heat, depending on a given family's tastes.
Everything vegetarian, energy-efficient, environment-friendly, and highly nutritious with many subtle tastes. Many
Gujarati dishes have a blend of sweetness. Dishes are not too sweet, but some are a bit sweeter than in other parts of
India.
<br>
Gujarati cuisine is in many ways unique from other culinary traditions of India. It is one of the few cultures
where a majority of people are vegetarians. This vegetarianism may have originally sprung from religious
ideologies and beliefs of the region.
<br>
Gujarati cuisine is a blend of exquisite flavours and textures. A wide range of foods are cooked in Gujarati
homes, and a variety of typical traditional recipes come from different regions of Gujarat.
In short, Gujarati meal is a great deal more than the ordinary rotli, daal, bhaat ane shaak!
